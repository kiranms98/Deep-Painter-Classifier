1,Vincent van Gogh,1853 - 1890,Post-Impressionism,Dutch,"Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ËˆvÉªnsÉ›nt ËˆÊ‹ÉªlÉ™m vÉ‘Å‹ ËˆÉ£É”x] (listen); 30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. However, he was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh,50
2,Pierre-Auguste Renoir,1841 - 1919,Impressionism,French,"Pierre-Auguste Renoir, commonly known as Auguste Renoir (; French: [pjÉ›Ê oÉ¡yst ÊÉ™nwaÊ]; 25 February 1841 â€“ 3 December 1919), was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that ""Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau.""",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir,50
3,Rembrandt,1606 - 1669,Baroque,Dutch,"Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (; Dutch: [ËˆrÉ›mbrÉ‘nt ËˆÉ¦É‘rmÉ™(n)soËn vÉ‘n ËˆrÉ›in] (listen); July 15, 1606 â€“ October 4, 1669) was a Dutch draughtsman, painter and printmaker. An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative, and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid art collector and dealer.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt,50
